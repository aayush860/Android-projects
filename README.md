Few projects made while freelancing

This is a running project you can find it on App store by name of 'indianfood mart'.
This project basecially is a general store item ordering and management system.
This project is divided into two parts first is for customers and other one is for merchant.

For customers the can simply order general store items.
It can fetch current location and tell if services are available.
It can update items as many times as possible.
It has firebase integrated for notification system and smtp protocols for email system and even SMS service api for messaging.
Whenever new user registers or order is place information is stored on 000webhost server database.
Everytime new updated productd are fetched directly for DB using connection between php and android.

As merchents are non technical preson themselve i created an app for them so that they have an overview of Database and can update all items online without any trouble.
